<h3 class = "makesaga">Overview</h3>
8 Real Hampshire College Students have been selected to take part in this game. They control what their avatar decides to do in each chapter, and we write the story accordingly. Their avatar's luck and success in each chapter is determined by how many votes they have. You can vote for them!

		The scenario is Post-Apocolyptic Hampshire. People got SO mad at the Hype Committee that they turned into Zombies. Luckily our 8 characters were immune to the virus, but can they escape being eaten alive? There are rumors of food in SAGA, but will our characters starve to death before it's too late? The PVTA will be arriving at Hampshire on December 12th and it only has room for one more person! <br><br>
		
		There will be 1-3 new chapters every day. There is a team of 2 writers who shall not be named. Each chapter is written depending on what the players have chosen to do and based on how many votes each of them have.<br><br>
		
		Expect a lot of Hampshire Jokes, expect J-Lash, and I have a feeling a certain Halloween Headliner may show up. I hope you all enjoy.

		<h3 class = "makesaga">The Characters</h3>
		
		This voting system is in real time! If you upvote or downvote someone right now, everyone else viewing this page will see it immediately. Votes are counted at the moment the chapter is written. Their votes will determine their luck in each chapter. This is very similar to rolling a die in Deathfest (if you are familiar) On the left sidebar is a list of different things you will unlock if a character reaches a certain vote count.<br><br>
		
		Behind each of this avatars are the Hampshire Students they are based off of. They can submit a form that tells me what actions they want to do, and the last thing they have said will show up in the quote under their avatar.
		
		<br><br>You can also see their total Health, when this reaches 0 they will die. Each character started out with 100. The other two values are their status, and their location.

		There should be a lot of chapters written and to get the most fun out of this game I recommend reading them.
