	Habbitat was designed and built by the very recent Hampshire College alumn, Jonathan Pedigo AKA Honan, as the aftermath of his Div III: A Hyperlocal Manifesto. This website has evolved from the long, winding history of a website called ICUHampy, started Jan 2012 by JD DiGiovanni, who moderated the site anonymously under the alias NG. Now added to the team are Ajmal Jackson-Brown, and Emiliano Carillo. <br><br>We are looking for fast and talented developers and designers. Various skills we are looking for: Multiplayer Game Design, PHP/MySQL (Hack is +), Relational DB optimiziation, Node.js, Model-View-Controller knowledge, badassness, strong OOP skills, and UI Designers that aren't so posh, Paid$$$. Contact: <a href = "mailto:pedigojon@gmail.com">pedigojon@gmail.com</a><br>
	
	<h1 id = "what">WHAT</h1>
	
	The jargon would be a "Hyperlocal Aggregator" but really we just make cool shit you can do online with people in your community. Our goal is to provide your community with practically every localized web service you could imagine. From Chatroulette to News to Getting Laid to Gaming, if an idea gets some spice when confined online to one geographic community, we will cook it up. <br><br>If all you want to hear is fart jokes, rascists complaining, and penis ideas please download the app - <a href = "http://www.yikyakapp.com/">Yik Yak</a>. At Habbitat we take our content moderation very seriously and will not stand for what Yik Yak has allowed - promoting <a href = "http://www.thecollegefix.com/post/20089/">rascism and misogyny</a>, and <a href = "http://www.videtteonline.com/index.php/2014/09/17/yik-yak-app-faces-serious-criticism/">facilitating bullying leading to suicide</a>.
	<br>
	<h1 id = "why">WHY</h1>
	 Connections with the people around us are being severed by technology, its time we brought a sense of community back to the places we live, work, and study. I am sick of technology tearing us apart and creating spaces of isolation. Tech should nuance and enhance real life, not replace it.
	 <br>
	 
 	<h1 id = "future">FUTURE</h1>
	 I dream of a couple things for Habbitat &nbsp; 0) Allow Gesellschaft in Gemeinschaft via Webspace, better explained as facilitating the creation of new identities around people that already know everything about each other. &nbsp; 1) Destroy hyperlocal, rebuild it &nbsp; 2) Give life to professional gaming via community oriented competition &nbsp;
	 
	 <br>
	<h1 id = "history">HISTORY</h1>
	<a href = "http://icuhampy.tumblr.com">ICUHampy</a> started as a missed connections tumblr for Hampshire College in Jan 2012. JD DiGiovanni made it to bridge a missed connection of his own.<br><br>
	After Moderating it for a year, JD handed the reigns to Jonathan Pedigo, who built a custom website as <a href = "http://icuhampy.com/classic/">ICUHampy 2.0</a>. <br><br>After another year, the site was upgraded by Jonathan Pedigo to <a href = "http://icuhampy.com">ICUHampy 4.0</a> to become more than just a missed connections site incorporating secrets, drama, discussion, etc.
	<br><br>In 2014, JD and Jon recieved funding to turn ICUHampy into a buisiness. The site went through a stylistic rebrand, trashing its sketchy mysterious vibe,  and became <a href = "http://icu.university">icu.university</a> with a cute little owl for a logo. The website returned to missed connections as the main service, with the addition of "The Hole" - as a place to keep all the denied posts. It managed to expand to Amherst College, but the traffic was not at the level the team wanted it. <br><br>
	
	At the start of 2015, the business then pivoted to become Habbitat, which essentially swallowed ICU whole, keeping it as one of the many services it would then provide for its communities.
