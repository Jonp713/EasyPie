		As you can tell, we’ve been up to a lot this Summer. Here is a quick and dirty break-down of what we have going on on this new site.

	<center><span class = "homecat">ICU…5?</span></center> Taking a 5-college class just got more interesting. We’re expanding to the five colleges starting with Hampshire. Soon enough you can follow ICU feeds at UMass, Smith, Mount Holyoke, and Amherst.

	<center><span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-user"></span><br><span class = "homecat">Accounts</span></center> Making an account is the best way to make use of the new functions on ICU. With an account you can save posts, receive messages from people who reply to your posts, keep track of your points, and set up a personal feed. Don’t worry - all your activity on ICU is still anonymous and we don’t send you spam.

	<center><span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-comment"></span><br><span class = "homecat">Messages</span></center> We have motherfucking messages. Isn’t that cool? You post about that super smart and attractive person in your gender studies class, they see it, they’re curious and want to connect, they message you, you two exchange digits, you two get Atkins donuts and talk Foucault. Amazing. Connections. Wow. Messages fucking rock. You’re welcome.

	<center><span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-star"></span><br><span class = "homecat">Saving Posts</span></center> Like a post or think it may be about a friend of yours? You can save it to your profile for easy access or use the share function and post it on Facebook, twitter, etc.

	<center><span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-list"></span><br><span class = "homecat">Personal Feed</span></center> Once we start expanding to different schools in the 5 colleges, you can subscribe to their feeds and have it show up on your profile.

	<center><span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-bullhorn"></span><br><span class = "homecat">New Moderation Policy</span></center> We’ve re-written the rulebook and everyone is going to see it. You can see what criteria the moderator is using to approve/deny posts and keep them honest by flagging posts that aren’t up to snuff.

	<center><span class = "glyphicon glyphicon-flag"></span><br><span class = "homecat">Flagging posts</span></center> This is a way to let ICU management know that you think a moderator isn’t following policy when vetting posts. With this community feedback you help keep ICU a fun place for everyone.
